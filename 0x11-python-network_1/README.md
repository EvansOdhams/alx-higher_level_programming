0x11. Python - Network #1
Description
This repository contains solutions for the 0x11. Python - Network #1 project at Holberton School. The project focuses on teaching the fundamentals of fetching internet resources using Python, specifically with the urllib and requests packages. Additionally, it covers topics such as making HTTP requests, decoding responses, handling JSON resources, and manipulating data from external services.

Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

General
Fetch internet resources using the Python package urllib.
Decode urllib body responses.
Utilize the Python package requests for simpler HTTP requests.
Make HTTP GET requests.
Make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. requests.
Retrieve and manipulate JSON resources from external services.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
All files should end with a new line.
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
A README.md file at the root of the folder of this project is mandatory.
Your code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
All files must be executable.
The length of your files will be tested using wc.
All modules should have proper documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)').
Use get to access dictionary values by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary).
