How to Use 2-matrix_divided.py
This module defines a function called matrix_divided(matrix, div) that can be used to divide all elements of a matrix by a given divisor.
Usage
The matrix_divided(matrix, div) function returns a new matrix that is a copy of the parameter matrix with all elements divided by div. The quotients are rounded to a maximum of two decimal places.
Here's an example of how to use the matrix_divided(matrix, div) function:

from 2-matrix_divided import matrix_divided

matrix = [
    [3, 6, 9],
    [12, 15, 18]
]

result = matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

print(result)

This will output:
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Note that the original matrix is left unchanged.
The matrix_divided(matrix, div) function can also handle floating-point numbers. Here's an example:

from 2-matrix_divided import matrix_divided

matrix = [
    [1.1, -2.2, 3.3],
    [4.4, 5.5, -6.6]
]

result = matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

print(result)

This will output:
[[0.37, -0.73, 1.1], [1.47, 1.83, -2.2]]

Integers and floats can be combined as well. Here's an example:

from 2-matrix_divided import matrix_divided

matrix = [
    [1, -2.2, 3, 4.4, 5],
    [-6.6, 7.00, 8, 9.999, 10]
]

result = matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

print(result)

This will output:
[[0.33, -0.73, 1.0, 1.47, 1.67], [-2.2, 2.33, 2.67, 3.33, 3.33]]
