# Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Python
This project focuses on practicing test-driven development (TDD) principles using Python. It involves writing tests before implementing the actual code, emphasizing the importance of documentation, test coverage, and handling edge cases.

# Requirements
Python 3.8.5
pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style enforcement)
Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

Python Scripts: Python files containing the implementation code for the tasks.
Tests: Text files containing doctests, which serve as interactive tests for the code.

# Installation
Clone the project repository:
## git clone https://github.com/EvansOdhams/alx-higher_level_programming

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
## python3 -m venv venv
## source venv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies:
## pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To execute the tests and validate the project implementation, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project's root directory:

## cd tdd-python

Run the tests using the following command:
## python3 -m doctest ./tests/*

This command will execute the doctests present in the test files and check if the expected output matches the actual output.

Review the test results and make necessary adjustments to the code to ensure all tests pass successfully.
