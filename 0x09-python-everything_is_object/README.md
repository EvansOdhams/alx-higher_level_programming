# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
This project explores the concept of objects in Python and delves into understanding their behavior. It consists of answering a series of questions related to Python's object-oriented nature, mutability, aliases, references, and more.

#Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

Understand the fundamentals of Python programming and appreciate its versatility
Differentiate between classes, objects, and instances
Distinguish between immutable and mutable objects
Comprehend the concepts of references, assignments, and aliases
Identify identical variables and linked objects
Display variable identifiers (memory addresses) in the CPython implementation
Recognize and utilize built-in mutable and immutable types
Gain insights into how Python passes variables to functions

## Repository Contents
