Python Data Structures: Lists and Tuples

This project focuses on the fundamentals of Python data structures - specifically lists and tuples. The goal is to develop a solid understanding of how to use these data structures effectively, and to become familiar with their most common methods and use cases.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following topics:

Why Python programming is a great choice for data manipulation tasks
What lists are and how to use them
The differences and similarities between strings and lists
Common methods for working with lists, such as append, insert, and remove
How to use lists as stacks and queues
What list comprehensions are and how to use them
What tuples are and how they differ from lists
When to use tuples instead of lists
What a sequence is, and how to use it
Tuple packing and unpacking
The del statement and how to use it
