0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory contains tasks for the Holberton School's "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions" project. In this project, we will be learning about control flow tools in Python, including if/else statements, loops (while and for), functions, and more.

Requirements

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
python3 (version 3.8.5)

PEP 8 style guide

All programs should be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 or newer using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
File Descriptions
0-positive_or_negative.py: This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

1-last_digit.py: This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number and prints the last digit of that number.
2-print_alphabet.py: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3-print_alphabt.py: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters q and e.
4-print_hexa.py: This program prints all the numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
5-print_comb2.py: This program prints all possible combinations of two digits from 00 to 99, separated by , .
6-print_comb3.py: This program prints all possible combinations of two digits from 00 to 99, separated by , , in ascending order.
7-islower.py: This program checks for lowercase characters and returns True if the character is lowercase and False otherwise.
8-uppercase.py: This program prints a string in uppercase.
9-print_last_digit.py: This program prints the last digit of a number.
10-add.py: This program adds two integers and returns the result.
11-pow.py: This program computes a to the power of b and returns the result.
12-fizzbuzz.py: This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three, Fizz is printed instead of the number. For multiples of five, Buzz is printed instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, FizzBuzz is printed instead of the number.
13-insert_number.c, lists.h: This program inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
100-print_tebahpla.py: This program prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.
101-remove_char_at.py: This program creates a copy of a string with the character at a given position removed.
102-magic_calculation.py: This program replicates the bytecode of a given Python function.
