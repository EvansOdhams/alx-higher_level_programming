## Description

This project is part of the ongoing second chance projects and focuses on building a foundational understanding of JavaScript programming. The project is supervised by Guillaume and has a weight of 1 point. The project started on Aug 14, 2023, at 6:00 AM and must be completed by Aug 17, 2023, at 6:00 AM. An auto review will be launched at the deadline to assess the progress.

### In a Nutshell

Auto QA review:
- Mandatory: 0.0/113
- Optional: 0.0/29
- Altogether: 0.0%

### Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that finds applications in scripting and web front-end development. In this project, we will focus on the scripting aspect of JavaScript to understand its basic concepts. Later, we will leverage JavaScript and JQuery for dynamic features in our AirBnB project.
