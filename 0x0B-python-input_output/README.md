#0x0B. Python - Input/Output
This project focuses on various aspects of input/output operations in Python. It includes tasks related to file handling, reading and writing files, working with JSON serialization and deserialization.

# Learning Objectives
Understand the importance of Python programming and its applications.
Learn how to open a file and perform operations such as reading and writing text.
Explore different techniques to read the full content of a file or read it line by line.
Understand cursor movement within a file.
Learn how to ensure proper file closure after using it.
Gain knowledge about the with statement for file handling.
Learn about JSON, serialization, and deserialization.
Convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.


## Files and Directories
0-read_file.py: A Python script that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints its content to stdout.
tests/: Directory containing test files for the project.


## Requirements
Python 3.8.5
pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style enforcement)
Setup and Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/alx-higher_level_programming.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x0B-python-input_output
Execute the script:

bash
Copy code
./0-read_file.py
This will read a text file named my_file_0.txt (UTF8) in the same directory and print its content to the terminal.

Run the tests:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
This will execute the test cases and verify the correctness of the implemented functions.
