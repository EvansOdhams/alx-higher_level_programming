#0x0A. Python - Inheritance
This project explores the concept of inheritance in Python. It covers topics such as superclass, subclass, multiple inheritance, method overriding, and the use of built-in functions like isinstance, issubclass, type, and super.

#Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

#Explain why Python programming is awesome
Understand the concepts of superclass, subclass, and inheritance
List all attributes and methods of a class or instance
Determine when an instance can have new attributes
Inherit a class from another
Define a class with multiple base classes
Understand the default class every class inherits from
Override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
Recognize which attributes or methods are available by inheritance to subclasses
Understand the purpose of inheritance
Use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions effectively


##Files and Directories
The project contains the following files and directories:

base.py: Contains the definition of the Base class, which serves as the base class for other classes.
user.py: Contains the definition of the User class, which is a subclass of Base.
tests/: Directory containing test files to validate the implementation.

##Requirements
Python 3.8.5
pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code formatting)

##Usage
To execute the code or run the tests, use the following commands:

To run the code:


python3 base.py
Copy code
python3 user.py
To run the tests:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
