Background Context
Object-oriented programming is a fundamental concept in Python, and this project serves as an introduction to OOP principles. It covers topics such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and information hiding.

It is important to read and understand the provided resources to grasp the concepts and best practices related to OOP in Python.

# Resources
The following resources should be read or watched to gain a thorough understanding of the concepts covered in this project:

Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod, and staticmethod yet)
Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON'T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The init Method, "Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding," "Public, Protected, and Private Attributes")
Properties vs. Getters and Setters
