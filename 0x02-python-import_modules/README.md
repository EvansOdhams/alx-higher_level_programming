0x02. Python - import & modules
This repository contains the code and solutions for the project 0x02. Python - import & modules, part of the curriculum for the Holberton School.

Description
The project contains several Python scripts that demonstrate how to work with modules, import functions from other files, create modules, and use command-line arguments in Python programs. The scripts also adhere to the PEP8 style guide and demonstrate how to use the pycodestyle tool to check for style errors.

Requirements
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Python 3.8.5
Pycodestyle 2.8.*
Usage
Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
Navigate to the project directory cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/0x02-python-import_modules
Run any of the scripts using the command ./filename.py
Files
0-add.py: imports a function from another file and uses it to perform a simple addition operation.
1-calculation.py: imports functions from another file and uses them to perform basic math operations.
