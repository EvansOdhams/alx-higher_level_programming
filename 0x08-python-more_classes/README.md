# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
This project focuses on further exploring the concepts of classes and objects in Python. It covers topics such as class attributes, instance attributes, special methods, data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding. The project aims to enhance your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and their implementation in Python.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of external resources:

## The advantages of Python programming
What is object-oriented programming (OOP)
First-class everything in Python
Understanding classes, objects, and instances
Differences between class attributes and instance attributes
Public, protected, and private attributes
The role of self in Python

## Methods and their usage in classes
The special __init__ method and its purpose
Data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding
Properties and their use in Python
Differences between attributes and properties
The Pythonic way of writing getters and setters
The special __str__ and __repr__ methods and their differences
Class attributes and object attributes
Class methods and static methods
Dynamic creation of attributes for existing instances
Binding attributes to objects and classes
Understanding __dict__ of a class and an instance
Attribute lookup process in Python
Usage of getattr function

## Requirements
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Python version: 3.8.5
Editor: vi, vim, or emacs
Code style: PEP 8 using pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)


## Files
The project contains the following files:

0-rectangle.py: Defines a class Rectangle that represents a rectangle shape.
1-rectangle.py: Builds upon the previous class and adds additional functionality.
2-rectangle.py: Further enhances the Rectangle class with getter and setter methods.
3-rectangle.py: Adds additional functionality to the Rectangle class.
4-rectangle.py: Continues to build upon the Rectangle class with more enhancements.
5-rectangle.py: Adds a class attribute to the Rectangle class.
6-rectangle.py: Implements a class method in the Rectangle class.
7-rectangle.py: Adds a static method to the Rectangle class.
8-rectangle.py: Explores the usage of class attributes and instance attributes.
9-rectangle.py: Implements a special method in the Rectangle class.
tests/: Contains test files to verify the correctness of the implemented classes.

## Usage
To test the functionality of the implemented classes, you can use the provided test files in the tests/ directory. For example, to run the tests for 0-rectangle.py, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m doctest -v ./tests/0-rectangle.txt
Feel free to explore and test the other files in a similar manner.
